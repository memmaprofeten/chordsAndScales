    \chapter{Chords}
    Learning chords is a cornerstone to learning guitar. Strumming chords is usually the first way a beginner plays the guitar.
    In chapter we explore the different chords for each note as I learn them, starting from the open major chord.


    \section{A chord}
    Starting from the first letter in the alphabet, the A chord is also one of the first chords that a guitar player learns,
    and is used in a lot of songs.

    \subsection{Open A major}
    This chord is preferrably played with the fingers "out-of-order" as listed in the chord-box.
    The fingering makes it easier to get all fingers close to the fret.
    The root is in the fifth string.
